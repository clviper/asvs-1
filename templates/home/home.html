                            <br>Level 1 is typically appropriate for applications where low confidence in the correct use of

                            or assisting in developing a prioritised list of security requirements as part of a multi-phase
                            effort. Level 1 controls can be ensured either automatically by tools or simply manually without
                            access to source code. We consider Level 1 the minimum required for all applications.

                            <br>Threats to the application will most likely be from attackers who are using simple and low effort
                            techniques to identify easy-to-find and easy-to-exploit vulnerabilities. This is in contrast
                            to a determined attacker who will spend focused energy to specifically target the application.
                            If data processed by your application has high value, you would rarely want to stop at a Level

                        applications that require significant levels of security verification, such as those that may be
                        found within areas of military, health and safety, critical infrastructure, etc. Organisations may

                        and even its survivability. Example guidance on the application of ASVS Level 3 is provided below.
                        An application achieves ASVS Level 3 (or Advanced) if it adequately defends against advanced application
                        security vulnerabilities and also demonstrates principles of good security design.
                        <br>
                        <br> An application at ASVS Level 3 requires more in depth analysis, architecture, coding, and testing
                        than all the other levels. A secure application is modularized in a meaningful way (to facilitate
                        e.g. resiliency, scalability, and most of all, layers of security), and each module (separated by
                        network connection and/or physical instance) takes care of its own security responsibilities (defence
                        in depth), that need to be properly documented. Responsibilities include controls for ensuring confidentiality
                        (e.g. encryption), integrity (e.g. transactions, input validation), availability (e.g. handling load
                        gracefully), authentication (including between systems), non-repudiation, authorization, and auditing
                        (logging).
